### **ðŸš€ Killer OpenTelemetry Collector Dashboard Metrics with Formulas**
A **killer dashboard** for your OpenTelemetry Collector should focus on **performance, data health, and error tracking**. Below are the **top metrics**, their **formulas**, and **why they matter**.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ 1. Collector Health & Performance**
These metrics help monitor the **stability** and **resource usage** of the OpenTelemetry Collector.

| Metric | Formula | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **CPU Usage (%)** | `otelcol_process_cpu_seconds_total / uptime * 100` | Tracks CPU usage of the Collector |
| **Memory Usage (MB)** | `otelcol_process_memory_rss / 1024 / 1024` | RAM usage of the Collector |
| **Uptime (mins)** | `otelcol_process_uptime / 60` | Time since the Collector started |
| **Open File Descriptors** | `otelcol_process_open_fds` | Helps detect file descriptor leaks |
| **Active Threads** | `otelcol_process_threads` | Number of active processing threads |

ðŸ”¹ **Why?** These metrics help you **spot performance bottlenecks** and **avoid crashes due to resource exhaustion**.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ 2. Incoming Data (Receiver Performance)**
These metrics track **how much telemetry data the Collector is receiving** and whether it's dropping any.

| Metric | Formula | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Spans Received Per Second** | `rate(otelcol_receiver_accepted_spans[5m])` | Measures incoming spans per second |
| **Logs Received Per Second** | `rate(otelcol_receiver_accepted_logs[5m])` | Logs received per second |
| **Metrics Received Per Second** | `rate(otelcol_receiver_accepted_metric_points[5m])` | Metric points received per second |
| **Span Drop Rate (%)** | `otelcol_receiver_refused_spans / (otelcol_receiver_accepted_spans + otelcol_receiver_refused_spans) * 100` | % of spans dropped |
| **Log Drop Rate (%)** | `otelcol_receiver_refused_logs / (otelcol_receiver_accepted_logs + otelcol_receiver_refused_logs) * 100` | % of logs dropped |
| **Metric Drop Rate (%)** | `otelcol_receiver_refused_metric_points / (otelcol_receiver_accepted_metric_points + otelcol_receiver_refused_metric_points) * 100` | % of metric points dropped |

ðŸ”¹ **Why?** A high **drop rate** means **the Collector is overloaded** and could be **losing telemetry data**.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ 3. Processing Performance (Queue & Batch Efficiency)**
These metrics track **how efficiently the Collector is processing telemetry**.

| Metric | Formula | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Batch Send Size (Avg per Export)** | `avg(otelcol_processor_batch_send_size)` | Tracks batch size efficiency |
| **Processing Latency (ms)** | `histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(otelcol_processor_batch_send_latency[5m]))` | Measures processing delay |
| **Queue Length** | `otelcol_queue_size` | Number of items waiting to be processed |
| **Queue Drop Rate (%)** | `otelcol_queue_dropped_items / (otelcol_queue_size + otelcol_queue_dropped_items) * 100` | % of items lost due to queue overflow |

ðŸ”¹ **Why?** If queue sizes are too high or batch latency is increasing, you may need to **scale up the Collector**.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ 4. Outgoing Data (Exporter Success & Failures)**
These metrics track **how much data is successfully sent to Lumigo** vs. **how much is failing**.

| Metric | Formula | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Spans Sent Per Second** | `rate(otelcol_exporter_sent_spans[5m])` | Number of spans exported per second |
| **Logs Sent Per Second** | `rate(otelcol_exporter_sent_logs[5m])` | Number of logs exported per second |
| **Metrics Sent Per Second** | `rate(otelcol_exporter_sent_metric_points[5m])` | Number of metric points exported per second |
| **Span Export Failure Rate (%)** | `otelcol_exporter_failed_spans / (otelcol_exporter_sent_spans + otelcol_exporter_failed_spans) * 100` | % of failed span exports |
| **Log Export Failure Rate (%)** | `otelcol_exporter_failed_logs / (otelcol_exporter_sent_logs + otelcol_exporter_failed_logs) * 100` | % of failed log exports |
| **Metric Export Failure Rate (%)** | `otelcol_exporter_failed_metric_points / (otelcol_exporter_sent_metric_points + otelcol_exporter_failed_metric_points) * 100` | % of failed metric exports |

ðŸ”¹ **Why?** If failure rates are too high, **telemetry data isn't reaching Lumigo**, which could impact observability.
